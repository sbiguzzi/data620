    "## Assignment Description\n",
    "This week's assignment is to:\n",
    "1. Load a graph database of your choosing from a text file or other source. If you take a large network dataset from the web (such as from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/), please feel free at this point to load just a small subset of the nodes and edges.\n",
    "2. Create basic analysis on the graph, including the graphâ€™s diameter, and at least one other metric of your choosing. You may either code the functions by hand (to build your intuition and insight), or use functions in an existing package.\n",
    "3. Use a visualization tool of your choice (Neo4j, Gephi, etc.) to display information.\n",
    "4. Please record a short video (~ 5 minutes), and submit a link to the video as part of your homework submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Steps\n",
    "### Loading graph\n",
    "First import the libraries necessary for this assignment: `networkx` as \"nx\" and `network` from `pyvis` as \"net\". We also import `pandas`."

Since Bitcoin users are anonymous, there is a need to maintain a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users. Members of Bitcoin OTC rate other members in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. This is the first explicit weighted signed directed network available for research._\""
